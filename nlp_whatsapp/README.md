### Applying NLP to my WhatsApp Data


For this, I wanted to grow my own understanding of the NLTK library,
whilst finding some interesting insight in some of my own textual,
WhatsApp data.

The .ipynb file may take a while to load in the browser...

To download your own WhatsApp data: In a chat, click on the chat name/
contacts name (at the top) and then near the bottom of the info page
click on 'export chat' without media.
The chat can then be saved as a zip file which needs to be unzipped and
the csv placed in a 'data' folder relative to the jupyter notebook.

The code is commented and should be fairly straightforward to follow :v:
