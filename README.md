A Repo for my mini side-projects.
<br>
<br>
<br>

:iphone: <b>iphone_activity_data:</b> Explore data downloaded from my
iPhones "Health" app.
Insight drawn from the data, regarding my daily routine (as a yearly
time series) and sleep statistics - using a combination of (mostly)
Pandas and Seaborn.

:soccer: <b>kmeans_clustering:</b> A practical example of K-means clustering
using FIFA 18 player data and the Sk-learn python library.
Premier league players attributes are subject to PCA and K-means
clustering, from which their similarities in playing styles are visually
compared.

:incoming_envelope: <b>nlp_whatsapp:</b> An example of how the NLTK library
can be used to gain insight from textual data.
Classifying Dialogue, POS tagging, Lexical Diversity, Emojis, Sentiment,
and an added bonus of some time series analysis.

:trophy: <b>fantasy_premier_league:</b> I probably spend too much time
on Fantasy Premier League... Here, I use the FPL python API wrapper to
download some of my leagues data to (ultimately) make some nice plots.
