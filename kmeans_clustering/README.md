### K-means clustering Fifa 18 data :football:

The data I used for this is from the EA Sports game - FIFA 18.
I downloaded it as a Kaggle dataset here:
https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/fifa-18-demo-player-dataset/data

Two separate K-means clustering algorithms are run on the data; the
first examining similarities of playing styles of players from two
different teams, and the second scrutinizing the varying playing styles
of all Premier league full-backs.

The code is fully commented and quite self-explanatory :thumbsup:
